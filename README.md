# The bat-o-matic
An Arduino based birdfeeder with various sensors and custom design.
*by Dr. Bryan Heidorn, Rafael Lopez, and Bobby Hitz*


## Overview

### Background and Rationale

The Bat-O-Matic project was created by Dr. Bryan Heidorn who is involved in the study of nectar feeding bats. Nectar feeding bats include a few species who have been on endangered species lists for the last few decades.  In an effort to study these species and contribute to the scarce research of these species, Dr. Heidorn created a few iterations of an Arduino driven sensor array placed on a bird feeder to count the number of bat licks throughout the night. 

The first few iterations of the Bat-O-Matic have helped identify a few design concerns that need to be addressed. Firstly, the arduino needs a permanent housing to facilitate mounting the sensors in the outdoors. The next design concern is power consumption. On busy nights, the sensor uses more power which can result in power loss which halts the data logging. Lastly, we need to explore the implementation of new sensors to expand the data collection abilities of the device. 


## Hardware and Software Requirements

The Bat-O-Matic is designed to fulfill its primary role as an easy to distribute device for research. Components can be swapped for similar parts from other manufacturers and should work but are not guaranteed to function with this project's software without further modifications.

*The component list is updated as features are implemented.*
